# UX and UI

Base on work done for [project 1](https://github.com/osk/maltaekni-v1).

## UX

Work sketches to code and prototype in browser.

## UI

Mobile first (only?)

How to show "training material"?

## Data quality

How to make sure we get good data?

Should it use the _Gated Instruction_ protocol described in [Effective Crowd Annotation for Relation Extraction](https://aclanthology.org/N16-1104.pdf) to "train" people in marking relations.

Store hash of IP + User agent along with timestamp. Allows for grouping and removing data if quality falls below some threshold. How do we define such a threshold?
